# Crypto Gem Detector

Crypto Gem Detector is a Node.js application that helps users identify potential cryptocurrency gems with the potential for significant price movements. It gathers data from various sources, analyzes it to identify potential gems, assesses the associated risks, and notifies users about potentially risky gems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


2. Install dependencies:

npm install


3. Run the application:

node index.js


## Usage

The application consists of several components:

- **Data Gatherer**: Responsible for gathering crypto data from various sources.
- **Data Analyzer**: Analyzes the gathered data to identify potential gems.
- **Risk Assessment**: Assesses the risks associated with potential gems.
- **Notification System**: Notifies users about potentially risky gems.
- **User Interface**: Displays the results to the user.

## Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the logic in each component to suit your needs. For example, you can add additional data sources, modify the criteria for identifying potential gems, or adjust the risk assessment algorithm.
